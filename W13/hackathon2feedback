Emergency Services Info & Missing Persons Board
This project tackles two key components. 
Firstly, it provides vital info on emergency services like police and hospital locations, aiding individuals in crisis.
 Secondly, it serves as a virtual missing persons board, aiding family reunification during conflicts.
The UI of this project is quite good.
I like the fades between screens, nice colors, navbar ect.
The circular loading animation is a really nice touch too!
Your file structure is good with models,controllers and routes.
There is still code thats commented out - so a little cleaning wouldnt do any harm.
Overall the code is implemented well, without any issues.
Fantastic job!
